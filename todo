topmost right toggle button to be used to toggle proxy routing inside chrome
a check button in settings page, (auto start tor on app start)

rough layout
----------------------------------------
krotor (about etc)
   ---------------------------------

suggestion
> what do you think about giving border to the GUI
> settings screen and about screen child elements
